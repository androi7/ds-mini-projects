Basic data analysis is applied on two different data sets. One set consists of SAT scores from students while the other describes the drug consumption of several age groups.

## Motivation
This work was done during the **Data Science Immersive** course from GA representing the second project. The goal is to getting familiar with data analysis tools, calculating basic statistics and to visualize the results.
