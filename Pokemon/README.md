# Pokemon Stay
---
Pokemon Stay comprises a simple container of pokemon trainers and their pokemons to calculate a small set of descriptive statistics.

## Motivation
The Pokemon Stay game represents the first project of the **Data Science Immersive** course from GA ([General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)) to cover the basics of Python.

## Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Additional Implementation: Type checking (**mypy**)

## Features
The project is done on one hand with imperative programming ([pokemon_stay.ipynb](pokemon_stay.ipynb)) and on the other hand with object oriented programming ([pokemon_stay_oop.ipynb](pokemon_stay_oop.ipynb)).
