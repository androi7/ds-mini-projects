 # Regression and Classification with Ames Housing Data
---
In the first place the house prices of a housing dataset are predicted by fixed features. In a second approach renovateable features are brought in to predict which houses are worth to buy and renovate to sell them lucratively. In a last step a classification problem is applied to determine the feature importance of classifying abnormal sale conditions.

## Motivation
This work was done during the **Data Science Immersive** course from GA representing the third project. The goal is to apply multiple regression and classification models and to evaluate them to find the best model.
